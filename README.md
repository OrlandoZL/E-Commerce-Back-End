# E-Commerce-Back-End

## Description

I Created this project using MYSQL2, Express, DOTENV, and Sequelize. I created this so that an e-commerce company can manage their database on products, tags, and categories. This used api routes to get the database data for Tags, Products, and Categories. The motivation for this project was to get used to seeds and models and to better my knowledge in routes. I also was able to get more familiar with Insomnia.
